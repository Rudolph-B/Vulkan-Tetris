# Vulkan Tetris

This is a very rudimentary Tetris clone written in C++ using the Vulkan API. It is missing some features, 
such as a game-over screen, score, control and music.

I wrote this over a period of 2 days (26-28 May 2023) as a means to show I have a decent understanding of graphics pipelines.
Although it is rushed I am proud of the code I have written and I hope you enjoy it.

## Controls
- Moving the piece: `Left` and `Right` arrow keys
- Rotating the piece: `Up` arrow key
- Dropping the piece: `Down` arrow key
- Instantly drop the piece: `Space` key
- Quitting the game: `Escape` key
- Restarting the game: `Enter` key
- Normal mode: `1` key
- Hard mode: `2` key
- Increase speed: `PG UP` key
- Decrease speed: `PG DN` key
